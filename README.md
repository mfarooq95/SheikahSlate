**Sheikah Slate** is a community Discord bot built with Python utilizing *Hyrule-Compendium*—a The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild API—as well as its Python API wrapper *Pyrule-Compendium*, and the *Discord.py* library

*Hyrule-Compendium* and *Pyrule-Compendium* were created and shared by [gadhagod](https://github.com/gadhagod)

**Sheikah Slate** was created and is intended to be a community-used Discord bot for fans of the game to gain quick access to knowledge of Breath of the Wild's compendium, available in-game to players, all with a quick ping within community Discord servers

## In the future, the bot will no longer use the current API but will instead use an upcoming, more detailed API created by me—Pyrule Champion. Progress below will reflect the change in API
- [x] Connect to Hyrule-Compendium API data when users ping bot
- [x] Create repo on Github
- [x] Fully enrich returned content with basic, avilable Hyrule-Compendium data
- [ ] Make the Discord bot live and available for server invites and use
- [ ] Link users to Zelda wiki page for each returned item
- [ ] Enhance bot/compendium's encyclopedia with all Breath of the Wild data relevant to players/users
- [ ] Prepare bot for the sequel to Breath of the Wild and new compendium entries and data
